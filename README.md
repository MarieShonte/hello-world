just another repository
Hello everyone I am new to this space. Code is a good way for me to work on my self meaning orgainzing with steps and not rushing to complete something. So far I have learned HTML  CSS. My eyes have seen Python, and Java Script. There are a lot more techniques of coding I may need to pick up. I also know I must use the vocabulary in order to keep up with my fellow code veterens. I know I must pace myself to my needs first.
In the early 2000 Technology then was just starting, we didn't have 4g, we did however had dail-up: AOL, NET Zero, I am from that era and now its like living the Jetsons before the Skyrise and flying cars. I even remember my first time learning on a pc in East, Texas around 1988 I was maybe 4-5.
